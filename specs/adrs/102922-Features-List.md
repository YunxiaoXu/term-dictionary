# List of Features

## Updates
### Add
- We want a cancel button if a user decides not to post a particular term at all. This allows more flexibility for the user. (11-14-2022)

### More Ways to Search
Decided to add more flexible searchs.
- Search by exact match. 
- Case not sensitive.
- Search by substring. 

### Senior Engineer's Suggestions
Our team briefly met with the professor to demonstrate the functionality of our app. He gave some suggestions, including to consider the domain of our app and how the user is going to use it. One was to populate the database with term names for an "official" list of terms. However, due to the time constraints of the project, we decided not to consider these changes since this probably require a lot of redesign, and we still have priority features left to finish.
The decision is made that if we can finish all the priorities features by week 9 then we begin to discuess and implement these more advanced design and implementations.
