# Deployment Platform to Use

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to test out multiple deployment platforms in order to determine which will be the best to host our application.
The deployment platform mentioned in the decision doc 10-27-2022 is hard to use and doesn't fulfill our needs.

## Considered Options
The DevOps team made tried some available options:
- Heroku
- Firebase
- Netlify

Some Considerations Are:
- Paid or Not.
- Whether it is wasy enough to deploy. Wether the use of a platform requires extra learning curve. 
- How easy to automatically re-deploy our web after a change is made. 


## Decision Outcome
Heroku is not a free service and Firebase is complicated to use.
Given the considerations above, we decide to use the Netlify, which does not share the same issues as the other two platforms.
