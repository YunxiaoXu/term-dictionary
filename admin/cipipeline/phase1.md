# Phase 1 Pipeline Status
![phase 1 diagram](./phase1.png)
## Functional
Our group is using issues, branches, and pull requests in this phase. On the pull request, there are GitHub Actions checks, Netlify checks, and a manual review before the branch is pulled to dev. Our HTML and CSS validators, ESLint check, JEST Unit tests, and JSDoc are functional. After testing dev, we can pull request dev to main, which goes through more manual, Actions, and Netlify checks. After pulling to main, the site is deployed via Netlify. 
## In Progress
Though our automated Unit test and JSDoc are functional, we are still in the progress of writing complete tests and running the JSDoc action on working backend javascript files.
